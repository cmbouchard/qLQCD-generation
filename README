* python script to generate quenched lattice QCD gauge fields 
* user interface via generate.py
  - specify action (W=Wilson, WR=Wilson with rectangle improvement)
  - to tadpole improve, add "_T" to end of action
* helper functions and classes in gauge_latticeqcd.py and lattice_collection.py
  includes code to update the lattices and perform measurments.
* incorporates Panagiotis Stylianou's updates to original code including:
  - improved generation of updates via SU(2) matrices
  - use of multiprocessing
  - the addition of measurement code for several observables


To do:
* optimize (better numba implementation, ...)
* add gradient flow and scale-setting measurement code to determine lattice spacing
